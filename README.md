Generic structure at your meetings to follow:

Attendance: record attendance and report apologies for absence.
Notification of any other business: anyone can identify an issue to be discussed at the meeting.
Minutes: allow all team members to report corrections to the previous meeting minutes and accept the final version.
Progress since the last meeting: all sub-teams or team members to report very briefly what progress has been made since the last meeting.  The Kanban board is updated accordingly.
Next actions: the team is to agree next steps/actions.
Other business: other business identified at the start of the meeting is discussed.
